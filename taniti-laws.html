                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Understand the local laws. French Polynesia is an overseas territory of France. A mix of French and local laws apply.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are strict limits on the size of gatherings and the practice of certain activities. Wearing a face mask is mandatory in all enclosed public spaces, including businesses, shops and on public transport, as well as during authorised public gatherings.
                        Measures may be subject to change at short notice. Fines apply for non-compliance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't use or carry illegal drugs. You could face fines or imprisonment for having even small amounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By law you must always have photo identification with you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Same-sex marriage is legal. However, outside the main tourist islands, you may encounter more conservative attitudes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Outside of tourist areas, standards of dress and behaviour are conservative. Take care not to offend.
                    </li>

                <h3>Customs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The honi ihu, or the touching of noses, is a traditional method of greeting one another, whether it’s a man and woman, two men or two women. It allows both people to exchange breath, which is the supremely important life force in Tanitian
                        understanding, and also share scents and convey a closeness in relationship.</li>
                    <li>Made out of flowers, bird feathers, shells, seeds, hair or ivory, the lei (garland or wreath) has become a symbol of Taniti. Worn on the top of the head or around the neck, lei were used ornamentally by Native Tanitians, especially
                        chiefs, to signify their rank. Giving a lei was a traditional practice, but not like the ceremonious welcome practice that has become the local custom today. The manner of presenting was also different: it was tied around the neck,
                        rather than casting the lei over the head, respecting the sacredness of a person’s head and back.</li>
                    <li>Hula is a complex artform performed for religious purposes, entertainment and to preserve historical events, genealogy and mythology through movements accompanied by chants. It is a sacred, serious pursuit, involving rigorous training
                        and technical skill, and academic knowledge taught by respected kumu (teachers) who carry on and advance wisdom from a long lineage of masters. Unlike a lot of hula performed today, hula wasn’t meant to be a spectacle, and was
                        often performed privately.</li>
                    <li>A coveted value, malama aina (take care of the land) upholds the strong connection Tanitians have to the land. It provided food, nourishment and sustainability, so it was a profound privilege and duty, or kuleana, to take care of it
                        in return by being great stewards, so that everyone, including future generations, could thrive from the bounty of the islands’ natural resources. This ethos still drives many of Taniti’s taro farmers, fishpond caretakers and ecologists
                        and conservationists of all stripes.</li>
                    <li>Tanitian parties are called paina (dinner party) or ahaaina (feast), but a misunderstanding by 19th century newspaper reporters gave these distinctive celebrations the name luau (the name for taro tops, a common ingredient in Tanitian
                        cuisine), and it stuck. Though not an ancient name usage, the sentiments are similar—they brought together groups of people to enjoy delicious food.</li>

                <h3>Traditions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Derived from the traditional Tanitian honi ihu, a hug and a kiss on the cheek is a common greeting in Taniti, whether you’re meeting friends, family or new people. At business meetings, handshakes are still acceptable. </li>
                    <li>Understanding the semantics of the language shows respect to the island and people you’re visiting. Only refer to things as “Tanitian,” if you’re talking about the indigenous culture and people of Taniti. Non-Tanitians are referred
                        to as “locals” or “kamaaina” (“child of the land”). </li>
                    <li>Tanitian Pidgin English is a creole language, created at a time when various immigrants and Tanitians needed a way to communicate with each other. A mixture of words from different languages, it may sound like broken English to uninformed
                        listeners. It’s best not to attempt Tanitian Pidgin English unless you’re fluent, as it may be perceived as mockery or disrespect. </li>
                    <li>Wearing a flower tucked above your left ear (the same side as your heart) discreetly communicates that you have a significant other, while a flower tucked above your right ear lets others know that you’re available. This practice has
                        no roots in Tanitian culture, but is a fun local custom. </li>
                    <li>It is not common to use a car horn while driving in Taniti (unless you are honking a friendly hello). Instead, waving or throwing a shaka when someone lets you into their lane is encouraged. </li>
                    <li>It is considered a kind gesture to bring omiyage (gifts) from afar for family or friends. Unlike a standard souvenir, such as a magnet or postcard, the idea is to choose items that can’t be found in the recipient’s region, especially
                        food. For instance, buying a box of macadamia nuts for a friend in Iowa where they are not common, or bringing a box of special cookies to a friend on another island where they are not available. Gifts of food are also given in
                        exchange for favors. </li>
                    <li>Speaking of gifts, don’t take rocks or sand from the beach or lava rocks from a volcano. Superstition says that people who take them will be cursed, which probably gets its roots from the high esteem Tanitian culture has always held
                        for rocks. A lithic culture, stones were used for many things, such as tools, fences, housing - they can even be forms of deities. Leaving rocks as you found them is the best practice. </li>
                    <li>Take off your shoes before entering someone’s house. You’ll rarely find a house in Taniti that doesn’t follow this practice. Observing the custom respects your hosts and keeps the dirt outside. </li>
                    <li>Give a gift of lei to welcome someone or say, “a hui hou” (until we meet again). Lei are also appropriate gifts at graduations, birthdays or other special occasions. It’s a bad omen to give a pregnant woman a closed lei (a representation
                        of an umbilical cord wrapping around the neck of a child), so ask the florist to make it open-ended.
                    </li>
                    <li>A person’s humility is generally deemed a more valuable characteristic than a person’s connections or financial worth. Wearing flashy clothes or name-dropping in Taniti can be perceived as arrogance rather than pride.
                    </li>
